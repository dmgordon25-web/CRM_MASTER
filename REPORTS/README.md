# Build and Analysis Artifacts

Use this directory to capture supporting artifacts generated during build, test, and cleanup work. Organize files under subfolders as needed, but ensure each artifact type remains easy to locate.

- **Build logs**: Drop detailed logs from `npm ci`, build, or packaging runs.
- **Route maps**: Store visualizations or exports that document routing changes.
- **Import graphs**: Capture dependency graphs or module relationship diagrams.
- **Cleanup diff lists**: Record before/after diff summaries, especially for large refactors or removals.

Include timestamps in filenames when practical, and prefer open formats (`.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.png`, etc.) so they can be reviewed without proprietary tools.
